# TarejasBot
This is a bot that I created so my girlfriend and I could keep on top of tasks that we needed to do throughout the day so productivity could be easier

To get this working you will need to install the Python telegram wrapper from https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/python-telegram-bot and follow their instructions for getting setup

I made sure to add a lot of comments throughout my code but if I find that it is hard to understand for the people reading it I will try to add more documentation.
